# TODO: many auxilliary kernels in this module might be better optimized and we could
# benchmark alternative implementations for each of them, that could include
#    - using 2D or 3D grid of work groups and work items where applicable (e.g. in
# some of the kernels that take 2D or 3D data as input) rather than using 1D grid. When
# doing so, one should be especially careful about how the segments of adjacent work
# items of size preferred_work_group_size_multiple are dispatched especially regarding
# RW  operations in memory. A wrong dispatch strategy could slash memory bandwith and
# reduce performance. Using 2D or 3D grid correctly might on the other hand improve
# performance since it saves costly indexing operations (like //)
#    - using numba + dpnp to directly leverage kernels that are shipped in dpnp to
# replace numpy methods.
# However, in light of our main goal that is bringing a GPU KMeans to scikit-learn, the
# importance of those TODOs is currently seen as secondary, since the execution time of
# those kernels is only a small fraction of the total execution time and the
# improvements that further optimizations can add will only be marginal. There is no
# doubt, though, that a lot could be learnt about kernel programming in the process.
